You've been gripping rock bottom  
So long now that I don't recognize the look thats in your eyes and I know  
That you've been taking life for granted  
You've been sinking like a ship with no direction taking hits but I know

It's not who you are  
It's a lie that you believe  
When you're stuck in between  
These realities  
It's not who you are  
It's a lie that you believe  
When you're stuck in between  
These realities

You've been searching for answers  
To why you're here and what this all means  
You're just trying to numb the pain you hide  
But I believe in second chances  
You're denial wont bring you your happy ending  
So just let it go

It's not who you are  
It's a lie that you believe  
When you're stuck in between  
These realities  
It's not who you are  
It's a lie that you believe  
When you're stuck in between  
These realities

When you decide to put this down  
I know you'll finally find your crown  
It's all you  
It's all you  
I know your world is upside down  
But you could turn it all around  
It's on you  
It's on you

It's not who you are  
It's a lie that you believe  
When you're stuck in between  
These realities  
It's not who you are  
It's a lie that you believe  
When you're stuck in between  
These realities
